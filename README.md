Created in Visual Studio 2015 using C#.

Create a 234 tree to count the number of each word in a text document.  Start by creating a modified 234-Tree. The 234-Tree should be modified to record the Word and a word count.  Scan a text document and parse each word found.  Remove and discard all punctuation and make all words lower case.  One at a time, add each word to the tree.  If the word is already in the tree, increment the counter, otherwise, add the new word to the 234-Tree setting the new words counter to one.

Once the document has been scanned, use in order traversal to print the words in alphabetical order with the word count.
